/// @notice Minimal PaymentRails-bound Atum payment contract and ERC-1271 Permit2 owner.
/// @dev One module deployment is bound to one immutable PaymentRails. The PaymentRails funds the
///      contract through `execute`; the module emits the current available source
///      balance and destination details for an offchain keeper, and accepts raw Permit2
///      digests at its ERC-1271 surface. Those digests are validated as presented, against the
///      keeper alone, and only for callers in {isAuthorizedSignatureCaller} (Certora M-01).
///
///      The module does not compute request ids, source assets, fulfillment amounts,
///      or fees. The keeper derives source details from the log context and prepares
///      Atum payment requests from the module's available token balance offchain.
///
///      Failed deposits, refunds, and unused source balances remain in the module. The
///      keeper should watch {AtumIntentCreated}, Atum Escrow refund events, and module
///      token balances to initiate new payment requests from the available balance. For
///      funds that arrive outside `execute`, the keeper must call {syncAllowance} first:
///      the Permit2 allowance does not move with the balance, so an unsynced refund is
///      visible but not pullable.
