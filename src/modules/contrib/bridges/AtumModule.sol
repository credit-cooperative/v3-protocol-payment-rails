/// @title AtumModule
/// @custom:tier contrib
/// @custom:maintainer @atum-labs (security@atumlabs.xyz)
/// @custom:audit-status unaudited
/// @notice Minimal PaymentRails-bound Atum payment contract and ERC-1271 Permit2 owner.
/// @dev Each module deployment is permanently bound to one immutable PaymentRails. The module
///      is funded by that PaymentRails through `execute`, emits the current available source
///      balance and destination details for an offchain Atum keeper, and accepts generic
///      Permit2 digests at its ERC-1271 surface. That surface decides one thing -- whether the
///      authorized keeper signed the hash -- and one thing about the caller: only an address in
///      `isAuthorizedSignatureCaller` gets an answer, seeded with Permit2 at construction
///      (Certora M-01). Everything about the digest's CONTENTS is the constructing
///      application's to enforce, because ERC-1271 supplies no preimage to check them against.
///
///      The module does not call Atum Escrow, compute request ids, compute fulfillment
///      amounts, decode Atum witness data, inspect Escrow state, classify payment
///      outcomes, reserve per-payment balances, or store per-payment recovery metadata.
///      The keeper derives source chain/source asset/request id and selects fulfillment
///      terms offchain.
///
///      `execute` is a PaymentRails funding action and payment availability signal, not a
///      complete Atum payment order. It moves additional source tokens into the module
///      and emits the module's full current balance for that token. The keeper should
///      create Atum payment requests from the available source balance, not merely from
///      the amount pulled by one PaymentRails action. Failed deposits, Escrow refunds, and
///      unused source balances remain in the module and can be picked up by a later
///      keeper request.
///
///      Because that sweep pays out the whole balance, `execute` will NOT stage a second
///      destination on top of a non-empty balance: it records the route the current balance was
///      pulled for in `stagedRoute` and returns a failed result if PaymentRails is reconfigured
///      to a different one while funds are still held (Certora L-04). `validate` applies the same
///      guard, so a preview cannot report success for a call `execute` would refuse. Drain or
///      sweep first, then reconfigure.
///
///      That guard treats a zero balance as settlement, which a refund can falsify. It is scoped
///      to funds the module is CURRENTLY holding and makes no claim about funds that left and came
///      back: a refund arriving after the next route is staged is swept under that new route, and
///      the guard then also refuses the corrective change back. See {IAtumModule.stagedRoute} for
///      the full statement. Which destination a payment reaches is a keeper property throughout.
///
///      Keeper operating flow:
///      - Watch {AtumIntentCreated}; when emitted, read/use `availableSourceAmount` and
///        prepare a payment request for the available source balance.
///      - Watch Atum Escrow refund events and module token balances; when refunded
///        funds return, call `syncAllowance(token)` and then initiate a new payment request
///        for the current module balance. The allowance does not track inbound transfers, so
///        without the sync the refund is visible but not pullable (Certora L-02).
///      - Invalidate abandoned floating Permit2 digests before signing replacement
///        requests when those stale digests must not remain usable.
///
///      Pause is a rare fail-safe control for return-to-PaymentRails recovery. It blocks
///      new `execute` calls, ERC-1271 validation and `syncAllowance`, makes `validate` fail, and
///      enables return-to-PaymentRails recovery. It does not revoke Permit2 approvals, invalidate
///      digests permanently, block inbound refunds or direct transfers, prove refund
///      attribution, or undo already consumed Permit2 nonces.
